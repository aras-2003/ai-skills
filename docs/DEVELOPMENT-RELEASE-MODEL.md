# Development and release model

## Goal

Keep `main` current and useful for continuous development while `production` remains a reproducible personal runtime snapshot. Avoid long-lived stacked PR chains and stale integration branches.

## Branch model

- `main` is the stable integration branch. Every change enters through a pull request and required CI checks; direct pushes and force pushes are disabled.
- `production` is the explicitly promoted snapshot. It also accepts changes only through a pull request and required checks; no workflow promotes or merges it automatically.
- Work normally starts on short-lived branches. A pull request must pass `Validate skills` and `Domain integrity` before it can merge into `main`.
- Do not stack long-lived PRs for sequential phases when one consolidated change can be integrated and validated on `main`.
- Once a stacked/temporary branch is fully represented on `main`, close its PR as superseded.

## Personal-beta production rule

This repository is primarily a personal system. A temporary personal-beta exception may continue use only for a component already declared production, at the exact recorded version, while runtime evidence is pending. It does not authorize a new production promotion, a changed component/version, expanded scope or a wider audience. A new promotion must pass its current mandatory release gates for the exact artifact and channel. No exception covers a known unresolved high-severity failure. For an existing-component continuation, all of the following are true:

1. static contracts and repository validators pass;
2. package builds and artifact validation pass;
3. relevant deterministic/unit tests pass;
4. executor inputs remain isolated from evaluator rubrics;
5. runtime evidence gaps are recorded as `NOT_RUN` / `pending`;
6. no unresolved known high-severity failure exists;
7. the readiness exception has an owner and short expiry.

Personal-beta production is not the same as verified runtime PASS.

## Change flow

For normal incremental work:

1. create a short-lived branch from `main` and open a PR;
2. merge only after `Validate skills` and `Domain integrity` pass;
3. `.github/workflows/package-main-lab-plugin.yml` builds a Lab artifact from the exact merged `main` commit and uploads it as an immutable Actions artifact; it does not write to a branch;
4. install/run that exact Lab candidate and retain its runtime receipt;
5. fix blockers rather than weakening validators;
6. production is released only after an explicit user request. Prepare a promotion PR containing production packages built from the exact Lab `source_revision`; include `release/promotion-evidence.json` bound to the Lab release id and digest;
7. `.github/workflows/package-production.yml` validates the PR, all generated package manifests, the exact Lab-to-production source chain, and the runtime receipt. It never pushes or merges.

The promotion validator rejects mismatched revisions, missing runtime evidence, missing package digests, or missing run identity. Production PR merge is a human-triggered release action, not an automatic consequence of a `main` merge.

Behavior-bearing paths currently include `skills/`, `workflows/`, and `release/package.yaml`; changing them invalidates the active campaign pin and requires a new behavior baseline.

## Evidence discipline

- Offline/static checks are never described as runtime PASS.
- Historical PASS/FAIL remains bound to its original component version and source revision.
- A pending-evidence exception is limited to an already-declared production component and exact version, and records the gap, limitation, owner and expiry. It never authorizes a new promotion or materially changed version.
- Failures discovered in real use should become regression fixtures before the next meaningful release.

## Promotion cadence

Promote when there is a useful coherent increment, not for every edit. The expected steady state is:
- few or zero open PRs;
- current `main`;
- an immutable Lab candidate tied to one `main` source revision;
- one known `production` snapshot;
- explicit Lab runtime evidence for every production promotion;
- continuous learning from real use.
