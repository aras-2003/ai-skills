# Publishing Skills Factory Cloud Next — agent runbook

This procedure depends on available tools, execution context and platform review. It requires neither a particular model nor the original chat. Successful publication in an earlier run does not guarantee that a later credential handoff will be accepted.

## Recover the current instruction

The canonical document is `docs/SITES-PUBLISHING.md` on `aras-2003/skills-factory` main: https://github.com/aras-2003/skills-factory/blob/main/docs/SITES-PUBLISHING.md

Read it through the GitHub connector if a local clone lacks the file or is stale. Do not reset or overwrite dirty local source to recover instructions. This Site checkout's `PUBLISHING.md` is a mirror; compare it with the canonical document before publication. GitHub documentation updates do not automatically synchronize the remote Sites mirror. The temporary checkout path below is historical, not a permanent source of truth.

If the user explicitly selects an unmerged instruction PR, read its exact head version and use that selected procedure for the run. Record the PR/head SHA and report that main is still unchanged. On 2026-10-07, PR #155 held newer instructions than main; fetching main alone did not retrieve those changes.

## Identity and authorization

- Reuse `.openai/hosting.json` project ID: `appgprj_6ac56f2116588191a4a1ebc682c97865`.
- Site: Skills Factory Cloud Next, `https://skills-factory-cloud-next.arek2003.chatgpt.site/`.
- Source checkout in this machine: `/private/tmp/codex-skills-site`; verify it instead of assuming that a temporary directory still exists.
- GitHub `aras-2003/skills-factory` and the Sites source repository are separate repositories. Merging GitHub main does not publish the Site or automatically refresh its embedded Lab artifact.
- A request to publish is authorization for publishing the agreed changes. No additional conversational confirmation is needed. Platform approval review still applies.

## Required capabilities

Read the installed `sites-hosting` skill and discover native Sites tools: `get_site`, `create_source_repository_write_credential`, `update_environment_variables`, `save_version_and_deploy_private`, `get_deployment_status`, `list_site_versions` / `get_site_version`.

Use the current installed Sites plugin path from the skill catalog. In this verified session it is `/Users/arkadiuszkamrowski/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated-remote/sites/0.1.75`. Do not hard-code that version for future installations.

The native plugin provisions credentials, configures runtime and publishes versions. Its official local `scripts/site-workflow.mjs` synchronizes the source using Git internally. There is no discovered native tool that uploads arbitrary source files directly; do not invent one. Do not use an ad-hoc authenticated `git push`.

## Reuse already pushed source

Before minting a credential, check whether the requested operation can reuse already pushed, unchanged source. A saved version and its verified matching package can be deployed through native Sites tools without transferring a repository-write token to a terminal. Preserve the source SHA and archive provenance; do not use this to attach changed source to an older SHA or to bypass a rejected source push.

Identical-source publication does not necessarily create a new numbered version. On 2026-10-07, `save_version_and_deploy_private` with the unchanged version-11 SHA `9daa5b6d58e22338c32de0cd4842f09564ac8747` and its original package returned the existing version-11 ID and successfully redeployed it (`appgdep_6ac6622abc108191bea14a560b2a486b`). The attempted version-12 publication therefore remained version 11. Report the number returned by Sites. A changed-source version requires an approved official source workflow before saving/deploying.

## Execution steps

1. Call `get_site`. Verify the existing identity, current version, authenticated owner role and owner-only access. Preserve Site/plugin identity and access.
2. Test HTTPS without credentials: `curl --connect-timeout 10 --max-time 20 --silent --show-error --output /dev/null --write-out 'HTTP_STATUS=%{http_code}\nTLS_VERIFY=%{ssl_verify_result}\n' https://git.chatgpt-team.site/`. HTTP 400 with TLS verification 0 is sufficient transport evidence for this root URL; it is not a Git permission test.
3. Prefer a sandbox with working managed network access. If local sandbox DNS fails, a credential-free check may be submitted with `sandbox_permissions: require_escalated`. DNS failure is not an approval rejection. Successful transport proves neither repository authorization nor permission to deliver a credential.
4. Launch the official workflow with `exec_command`, `tty: true`, `yield_time_ms: 1000`: `node <plugin-root>/scripts/site-workflow.mjs --project-id <project_id>`. If requesting an escalated local context, describe the complete operation: network access, fresh repo-scoped credential through hidden stdin, source synchronization and private publication. This is a request for platform review, not permission to bypass a managed proxy. Approval to start the terminal does not automatically approve the subsequent credential transfer.
5. After `Ready for Site workflow JSON on stdin (input is hidden).`, obtain a fresh native credential and hold it only in orchestration memory. Submit newline-terminated `{credential}` through `write_stdin`, `yield_time_ms: 30000`, subject to that action's own review. Hidden stdin prevents display; it does not authorize transfer. Never persist or expose the token. If delivery is rejected, follow the credential boundary below; do not retry it through another route.
6. Wait for successful exit and retain the returned `source` object (`project_id`, `checkout_path`, `commit_sha`). If local edits already exist, preserve them; the workflow rejects incompatible remote history safely. Inspect relevant source and make scoped changes.
7. Prepare dependencies only when needed. Existing working `node_modules` may be reused while dependency inputs are unchanged. The Linux installer requires `flock` and GNU `timeout`; do not repeatedly reinstall or change the lockfile to solve this on macOS. Use the Sites execution-profile guidance for a new dependency installation. Run TypeScript with `--incremental false` so validation does not alter tracked `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`.
8. Launch the same official workflow in the same approved execution context. Send `{credential, source, commands, archivePath}` through hidden stdin. If the credential expired, obtain a fresh one through the plugin. Use absolute archive path and literal argument arrays. Remaining checks/build:
   - `["node", "node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc", "--noEmit", "--incremental", "false"]`
   - `["node", "scripts/check-contracts.mjs"]`
   - `["node", "<plugin-root>/scripts/build-site.mjs"]`
   The workflow checks, builds, commits source, pushes normally, verifies remote HEAD and packages the archive. Never bypass a failed push by saving an archive against an older SHA.
9. Only after successful workflow, use its exact returned SHA and archive. Update the non-secret runtime keys `SKILLS_FACTORY_RELEASE_ID` and `SKILLS_FACTORY_SOURCE_REVISION` to that SHA, and `SKILLS_FACTORY_DEPLOYED_AT` to current UTC time using the native plugin.
10. Call native `save_version_and_deploy_private` with exact returned project ID, SHA and archive. If a save succeeded but deploy failed, retain the saved version ID and retry deployment rather than creating duplicate versions. Poll a non-terminal deployment to `succeeded` or `failed`.
11. Confirm the actual saved version number and source SHA with native Sites tools. Confirm Cloud MCP `runtime_info` reports `verified` and the same Site SHA; check catalog and change-specific regression. For a chart change, inspect the SVG payload; claim inline Chat rendering only after visibly observing it in Chat.
12. Report deployed version, source SHA, deployment result, tests and remaining failures. A local build, GitHub merge or saved version alone is not proof of a live publication. Normal source updates reuse the existing plugin; installation refresh is only investigated if discovery actually changes or becomes stale.

## Credential review and recovery

### Evidence-based review for the official local workflow

Before requesting local network-capable execution, inspect the currently installed `site-workflow.mjs` rather than treating an arbitrary terminal as a trusted recipient. In plugin 0.1.75 the verified safeguards are: Site manifest ID validation, native credential HTTPS destination, rejection of Git URL rewriting, disabled HTTP redirects and Git tracing, no persistent credential configuration, and no credential in preparation-command environments. Authentication is scoped to the connector-returned repository URL for Git network operations. These are observed implementation facts, not a blanket safety guarantee for future plugin versions.

State the complete requested operation in the execution justification: the user-authorized private publication, exact Site ID, official script path, sandbox DNS failure, fresh repo-scoped credential delivered through hidden stdin, and the inspected safeguards. Keep terminal launch and subsequent credential delivery subject to their own review. Do not simply change model or resend a rejected credential. New verified evidence can support normal re-evaluation of the same official route; it cannot override a refusal. If rejected again, cancel and preserve source as described below.

On 2026-10-07, after this script inspection and complete execution justification, normal review accepted both terminal launch and hidden-stdin credential delivery; opening the existing source succeeded. This does not establish why the earlier review differed and does not prove a Luna/Sol permission difference. Use this evidence-based procedure with either model.

Approval to start a terminal or reach the host does not imply permission to deliver a secret to that process. `write_stdin` can be reviewed separately. Hidden input prevents display, but is not a permission mechanism. A model switch or previous successful run does not override a current rejection.

If credential delivery is rejected, cancel the waiting workflow without sending a token, discard the credential from orchestration memory and preserve source edits. Do not resend it through another process, wrapper, file, environment variable or connector. Do not mint repeated credentials to retry the rejected transfer. Continue independent local preparation.

Resume only when a supported execution route and platform approval permit credential delivery, or new evidence permits normal re-evaluation of the rejected action. Report the exact missing condition. Do not claim that the user can click an approval button unless the product actually presents one. Repeated conversational consent does not repair a platform enforcement rejection. This document cannot provision a missing managed proxy or approval capability.

Require workflow exit code 0 and a final JSON result with the matching project ID, full SHA and archive before publishing. For this macOS checkout, `packageManager` is `pnpm@11.25.0` and starting `corepack --version` returns `ENOENT`. The inspected plugin 0.1.75 `package-manager.mjs` tries Corepack, then permits PATH pnpm only for a missing executable (`startError === ENOENT`) without cancellation. That explains the intermediate `Unable to start the Sites workflow command` followed by a successful build here. Do not suppress the message or generalize it to policy errors: a started command failure or cancellation must not be retried by this fallback. Decide completion from the workflow exit and final JSON; investigate when those are missing.

If push succeeded but deployment failed, preserve the pushed SHA, matching archive and saved version/deployment IDs. Reconcile native state before retrying instead of blindly creating another version. Documentation-only maintenance updates the canonical GitHub file and local mirror without minting Site credentials. State explicitly when the remote Sites mirror remains pending source synchronization.

## Automatic private publication exception

If credentials are requested with `publish_on_push: private`, only skip native save/deploy when the returned `publish_on_push_accepted` is true. Reconcile the matching deployment rather than publishing twice. This runbook defaults to ordinary credentials and explicit private save/deploy so Site environment attestation can be set to the pushed SHA before deployment.

## Failure decisions

- Sandbox DNS failure: review the credential-free local execution path above; do not assume its approval covers credential delivery.
- Cloud `proxy:8080` connection failure: domain allowlists cannot repair an unreachable proxy. Use the already authorized local Codex procedure if available; do not send the user through repeated Cloud setup.
- Missing Sites tools: report the precise missing capability; changing internet settings does not install tools.
- Platform approval rejection: quote the actual rejected action and reason. Do not describe a DNS failure as an approval rejection.
- Failed tests, divergent source or rejected backend authorization: retain source and report the actual error. Do not force-push, substitute another Site or weaken access.

## Verified history and limits

On 2026-10-07, local Codex/macOS with native Sites tools and official workflow 0.1.75 published versions 8, 9 and 10 using reviewed local execution and hidden-stdin credential delivery.

Version 10: source `f5564234d14998329073f3358ed1aff0ea6c1502`; deployment `appgdep_6ac653342c988191b67b69d23d2c3e80`, `succeeded`; runtime configuration revision 4. TypeScript, 8/8 contract tests and build passed. Cloud MCP reported `verified` for that exact SHA, 70 skills, correct bar/line descriptions and `references/WORKFLOW.md` for `oaf-health-check`. Inline chart display in Chat was not verified. Embedded Lab remained 0.33.4 / `b5ce981af12003e8a8c00ed66efb58f3cee3c314`.

A subsequent version-11 attempt from this chat obtained transport and terminal-start approval, but `write_stdin` was rejected: delivery of a live repository-write credential to the already unsandboxed process outside the managed proxy was judged unauthorized credential egress. The workflow was cancelled without receiving the token. The code change and local checks passed, but that attempt did not publish version 11. The different review outcomes establish no verified model-specific cause.

Version 11 was subsequently published through the same official route after inspecting its safeguards and submitting the complete operation for normal review. Source `9daa5b6d58e22338c32de0cd4842f09564ac8747`; deployment `appgdep_6ac65dfb25f88191aa33772bef4c17ce`, `succeeded`; environment revision 5. TypeScript, 8/8 contract tests and build passed. Native Site state reports version 11 with the existing private plugin. Cloud MCP reports `verified` for that SHA; the line chart description matches SVG point tooltips and `oaf-health-check` exposes `references/WORKFLOW.md` without eval references. This outcome proves the route worked for this run, not guaranteed model-specific approval. The deployed Site mirror includes the inspected-safeguards procedure; this later outcome and Corepack explanation are maintained in the canonical GitHub document.

## Chat regression

Open a fresh ordinary Chat and explicitly select `@Skills Factory Cloud Next` from the plugin menu. Verify that an actual tool invocation is visible. Test prompts and model statements alone do not prove that MCP ran. Site source revision and embedded Lab source revision identify different layers; compare each against its corresponding source.

## Verified version 12 publication

On 2026-10-07, the official workflow published source `5a598bb0f6bd52b395b35da02107d1898213d980`; native private deployment `appgdep_6ac663cded1881919642b9abd4d7b668` succeeded as Site version 12 with environment revision 6. The routing microfix lowercases before replacing Polish `ł`, so `SZUKAJ SPÓŁEK` and `Szukaj spółek` select the same opportunity workflow. TypeScript, 8 contract tests and build passed. Live Cloud MCP confirmed both requests, OAF workflow references, 70 skills and verified attestation for the exact source SHA. An initial runtime-info read returned version-11 metadata; a follow-up after 15 seconds returned the new SHA. Check propagation before declaring a stale registration.

The review submission cited the human's earlier explicit approval in this conversation (`Tak, zatwierdzam`) of the specific short-lived token transfer outside the sandbox, alongside the inspected official recipient and repository safeguards. Normal review accepted opening and publishing after that evidence was presented. This is an observed successful run, not proof of the reviewer's internal reasoning or guaranteed future approval. Preserve direct user authorization when reporting evidence; do not treat a model switch, documentation text or repeated identical submissions as a substitute. A subsequent rejection still requires cancellation and safe recovery.
