# Skill Authoring

## Preconditions

Require an approved specification or reconstruct one with `skill-specification` first.

## Current authoring principles

1. Use the open Agent Skills package model:
   - `SKILL.md` required;
   - `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` optional.
2. Frontmatter must contain at least:
   - `name`;
   - `description`.
3. Treat `description` as routing metadata:
   - state what the skill does;
   - state when it should be used;
   - include recognizable user-goal language;
   - distinguish adjacent skills.
4. Keep detailed process and output requirements in the body.
5. Prefer imperative, executable instructions.
6. Explain decision rationale where it reduces brittle rule following.
7. Use progressive disclosure:
   - metadata is lightweight;
   - SKILL.md contains the core procedure;
   - deep references are loaded only when needed.
8. Keep SKILL.md concise enough to reason over reliably; move long domain material to references.
9. Use scripts for deterministic/repetitive logic.
10. Use assets for templates/resources used in outputs.
   - For reusable charts, diagrams, dashboards or executive visuals, define a semantic payload first and let `visual-output-design` select the rendering tool.
11. State tool order and missing-result handling explicitly when tools matter.
12. Preserve user agency: explicit user instructions override generic skill defaults unless higher-priority rules prevent it.
13. Follow the principle of least surprise: never hide destructive, external, privileged or security-sensitive behavior.
14. When the output is multidimensional or structural, define visual affordances without coupling domain logic to one renderer; prefer the shared `visual-output-design` presentation layer over bespoke ASCII diagrams or decorative pseudo-charts.

## Required body sections

Prefer:
- Purpose
- Preconditions
- Procedure
- Decision rules
- Inputs
- Output contract
- Evidence requirements
- Failure and uncertainty handling
- Quality checks
- References

Use "Use when" / "Do not use when" in the body only as explanatory detail; primary routing conditions belong in the description.

## Resource split rules

Move content to `references/` when:
- it is long;
- only some executions need it;
- it varies by framework/domain;
- it is factual/reference material rather than procedure.

Move logic to `scripts/` when:
- exact arithmetic matters;
- repeated parsing/transformation is deterministic;
- schema/static validation is feasible;
- reproducibility matters more than model judgment.

## Output

Produce:
1. package tree;
2. complete SKILL.md;
3. necessary supporting resources only;
4. authoring notes listing assumptions and unresolved questions.

Do not declare the skill production-ready. Hand off to `skill-validation`.
