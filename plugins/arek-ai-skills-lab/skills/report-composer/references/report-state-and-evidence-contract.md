# Report state and evidence contract

This contract separates analytical completeness, renderer execution, client display and runtime evaluation.
The model must never collapse these into one inferred success status.

## 1. Analysis state

Allowed values:
- `COMPLETE`: all decision-critical claims required by the selected workflow are supported.
- `PARTIAL_EVIDENCE`: the report can still provide useful analysis, but at least one decision-critical comparison, attribution, policy check or thesis check is unavailable.
- `BLOCKED_ANALYSIS`: missing evidence prevents the core requested analysis from being performed truthfully.

This state is independent of chart delivery.

## 2. Renderer capability state

Allowed values:
- `AVAILABLE`
- `UNAVAILABLE`
- `UNKNOWN`

Capability state only says whether a qualifying renderer can be invoked.

## 3. Renderer execution state

Allowed values:
- `NOT_REQUIRED`
- `NOT_ATTEMPTED`
- `BLOCKED_NO_RENDERER`
- `PAYLOAD_RENDERED`
- `FAIL_RENDERER_INVOCATION`

`PAYLOAD_RENDERED` means the renderer returned a valid, verifiable image/chart payload.
It does not mean the client UI displayed it.

## 4. Client display state

The language model does not observe the end-user client rendering surface.

Allowed model-owned value:
- `NOT_OBSERVABLE`

Do not emit `UI_CONFIRMED`, `UI_RENDER_UNCONFIRMED`, `VISIBLE`, `BROKEN` or equivalent as model-owned facts.

Client display may be evaluated only by:
- an external test harness with client telemetry/screenshot evidence; or
- explicit user feedback about what is visible.

Do not infer client display from tool-call success, image payload success, placeholder creation or absence of an exception.

## 5. Runtime validation state

This belongs to the runtime evaluation harness, not ordinary report composition.

Allowed values:
- `PASS`: external evidence confirms the required client-visible output.
- `FAIL`: a required capability or invocation failed.
- `PENDING_CLIENT_VALIDATION`: a valid payload was produced but client display has not been externally verified.

The model may describe the renderer payload as ready, but must not claim runtime visual-floor PASS without external client evidence.

## 6. Evidence classes

Every decision-relevant factual claim should resolve to one of:
- `CANONICAL`: read from the configured canonical record store.
- `USER_PROVIDED`: supplied directly by the user or prompt.
- `EXTERNAL_VERIFIED`: verified against an external dated source.
- `DERIVED`: calculated reproducibly from identified inputs.
- `UNKNOWN`: support is insufficient.

For `DERIVED` claims, preserve enough inputs/formula to reproduce the result.

A user-provided metric that cannot be reproduced from the visible inputs remains `USER_PROVIDED`; do not relabel it `DERIVED`.

## 7. Causal attribution gate

Claims such as:
- market-driven drift;
- trade-driven drift;
- thesis deterioration caused by a specific event;
- exposure changed because of a specific transaction or price move;

require evidence that distinguishes the candidate causes.

For portfolio drift attribution:
- current state alone is insufficient;
- current + prior snapshots can establish change, but not necessarily cause;
- transaction history plus comparable prior/current state, or an explicit canonical attribution record, is required to classify change as trade-driven vs market-driven;
- if this evidence is missing, attribution is `UNKNOWN`.

Never infer market-driven drift merely because no transaction data were observed. Absence of transaction evidence is not evidence of no transaction.

## 8. Contradiction check

Before final output, check that:
- limitations do not contradict earlier claims;
- missing history is not followed by a historical attribution;
- unavailable policy is not followed by a policy-breach claim;
- unavailable thesis records are not followed by a thesis-status claim;
- user-provided metrics are not presented as independently verified or derived;
- renderer payload success is not described as client-visible success.

If a contradiction exists, weaken or remove the unsupported claim before composing the report.

## 9. Presentation rules

For normal reports:
- keep the analytical report useful even when evidence is partial;
- summarize missing canonical evidence once in a compact limitations section;
- do not repeat the same unavailable records in multiple sections;
- do not expose internal state-machine jargon unless diagnostic output is requested.

For runtime diagnostics, use:
- analysis_state
- capability_status
- renderer_execution_status
- client_display_status
- runtime_validation_status only when evaluated externally

Never invent status variants outside the enums in this contract.
