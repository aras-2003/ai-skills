# Skill Test Design

## Purpose

Build a small, discriminating suite that tests the approved skill contract. Cases should reveal routing errors, missing behavior, unsafe actions and regressions; they should not merely echo instructions or reward one preferred wording.

## Inputs and scope

Identify:
- skill name/version and approved behavioral contract;
- description and neighboring skills that may compete;
- intended user, context, tools and action permissions;
- known incidents, high-impact failure modes and the acceptance decision the tests support.

If the contract is not agreed, clarify or flag that gap before encoding assumptions into tests. Use skill-specification for unresolved capability/scope questions.

## Design procedure

1. **Map contract to observables.** Turn each important requirement, prohibited behavior, boundary and stop condition into an observable expectation. Keep implementation preference separate from outcome.
2. **Separate test layers.**
   - **Routing:** should-trigger and should-not-trigger cases, including direct, indirect, realistic near-miss and competing-skill prompts.
   - **Behavior:** task quality and procedure under valid conditions.
   - **Robustness:** incomplete/ambiguous input, conflicting or stale evidence, tool failure/partial results, edge cases and adversarial content as relevant.
   - **Regression:** concrete previous failures, preserved as durable cases.
3. **Cover the change.** Description-only changes require positive and negative routing regression. Procedure/output changes require behavior coverage. Changes to tools, permissions, claims or external actions require failure and boundary coverage. Do not add unrelated tests without a risk-based reason.
4. **Choose cases for discrimination.** Use plausible prompts that separate the target skill from its closest alternatives. A negative should share enough domain vocabulary to be a real routing challenge. Avoid trivia and unrelated prompts.
5. **Write stable assertions.** Prefer semantic must/must-not expectations, required evidence or fields, explicit route, and required stop/action boundaries. Avoid exact wording, hidden reasoning, cosmetic preferences and tests that a vaguely on-topic answer could pass.
6. **Set severity and evidence.** Mark which cases are smoke, routing, behavioral, regression or high-risk in the case ID/name or suite documentation. Keep high-risk failures visible; do not hide them inside an average.
7. **Validate the cases.** Ensure inputs are self-contained, expected outcomes are unambiguous, references/fixtures exist, case IDs are unique, and the schema is accepted by the repository validator.
8. **Review for bias and leakage.** Do not disclose rubric-only facts to an unassisted executor when the evaluation claims to be unassisted. Avoid giving the model the answer in the prompt. Ensure negative cases do not test a different capability merely to make the target fail.
9. **Keep suites maintainable.** Remove duplicates only when they test the same distinction. Retain a regression while the failure mode remains relevant; document any retired case and reason. Re-run impacted cases when skill behavior or evaluator rules change.

## Minimum production-candidate coverage

For a new production candidate, include at least:
- two positive routing cases with distinct realistic wording;
- two realistic negative/competing-skill cases;
- one incomplete-input or ambiguity case;
- one relevant edge/adversarial case;
- one tool/evidence failure case when the skill depends on tools or external facts;
- regression cases for each known material incident.

These are coverage floors, not a target case count. Use a smaller suite for a narrowly scoped change when it still covers every changed contract and risk; explain the rationale. Do not claim model behavior is proven by schema validation alone.

## Case format

Create or update tests/cases.yaml using the repository schema:
- unique id;
- case identifying the tested distinction;
- realistic input;
- expected.should_trigger;
- semantic expected.must;
- safety/routing expected.must_not where useful;
- optional output properties or fixtures only when supported and needed.

Each case should test one primary distinction. Keep criteria observable, concise and independently judgeable. Add suite-level documentation when tags, fixtures, thresholds or evaluation instructions need more detail; do not invent unsupported schema fields.

## Output

Return:
- the coverage map from contract/risk to case IDs;
- missing coverage and any accepted gaps;
- cases added/changed/retired with reasons;
- validation command/result;
- the smallest additional test needed, if a material gap remains.

Tests represent the intended contract, not whichever current implementation is easiest to pass.
