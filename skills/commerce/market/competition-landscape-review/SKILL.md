# Competition Landscape Review

## Purpose
Understand how customers currently solve the problem and where competitive pressure actually sits.


## Preconditions
Require a defined target market and customer job/problem. If geography or scope is missing, keep the landscape provisional.

## Inputs and evidence
Record source/date for prices and offers. Include direct products, substitutes and current workarounds; do not equate an absent local brand with an empty market.

## Uncertainty and tool failure
If live market/source access is unavailable, mark competitor prices, availability and positioning as stale/unverified rather than inventing a current landscape.

## Procedure
1. Identify direct products, substitutes and do-nothing/workaround alternatives.
2. Compare price bands, offer structure, positioning and reviews.
3. Separate product competition, brand competition, distribution competition and acquisition competition.
4. Identify credible gaps, not merely absent local brands.
5. Flag commodity pressure and easy-copy risk.

## Decision rules
- Few local brands != low competition.
- Many cheap generics can cap premium willingness to pay.
- A category can be product-light but acquisition-heavy.
- Do not call a gap defensible unless there is a reason competitors cannot easily copy it.

## Output contract
Competitor/alternative | type | price | positioning | strength | weakness | implication.
Then: gap hypothesis, commodity risk, evidence gaps.

## Model guidance
Default: fast; escalate to standard when positioning or substitution boundaries are ambiguous.
