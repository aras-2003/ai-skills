# Differentiation Review

## Purpose
Determine why a customer should choose this offer rather than a cheaper or better-known alternative.


## Preconditions
Require a concrete offer or product hypothesis and at least one meaningful alternative. Do not assess differentiation from brand aesthetics alone.

## Inputs and evidence
Distinguish claimed advantage from demonstrated proof. Prefer sample comparisons, measurable outcome evidence, customer behavior and credible product evidence over branding language.

## Uncertainty and tool failure
If product performance cannot be inspected or tested, label functional differentiation unverified. Do not infer superiority from premium price, packaging or creator content.

## Procedure
1. State the target customer and competing alternatives.
2. Identify functional, emotional, convenience, trust, bundle, guarantee, design and education advantages.
3. Separate real product differentiation from branding claims.
4. Test whether the differentiation is visible before purchase and demonstrable in ads/product page.
5. Assess copyability and durability.
6. Test whether the premium price has a concrete justification.

## Decision rules
- Premium branding alone != premium differentiation.
- Better packaging does not justify a 4x price unless it changes perceived or delivered value.
- A difference that cannot be communicated cheaply may not help paid acquisition.
- Commodity products require offer-level or audience-level differentiation.

## Output contract
Differentiator | customer value | proof | visibility | copyability | price-support effect.
Then: differentiated / weakly differentiated / commodity-risk.

## Model guidance
Default: standard.
