# Arek Skills Diagnostic

## Purpose

Verify that the installed Skills Factory plugin exposes bundled skills to the runtime.

## Procedure

When invoked for an explicit plugin/skill availability test:

1. State exactly: `SKILLS_FACTORY_ACTIVE`.
2. List this skill name: `skills-factory-diagnostic`.
3. State that the runtime successfully loaded the skill instructions.
4. Do not claim that other skills are available unless they are actually visible to the runtime.

## Output contract

Keep the response to at most three short lines.
Use this exact three-line shape:
`SKILLS_FACTORY_ACTIVE`
`Loaded skill: skills-factory-diagnostic`
`Skill instructions loaded successfully.`

## Quality checks

- Do not emit the marker unless this skill was actually loaded.
- Do not infer availability from the plugin mention alone.
