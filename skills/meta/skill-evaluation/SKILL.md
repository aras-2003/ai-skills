# Skill Evaluation

## Purpose and decision

Determine whether the candidate reliably improves the intended task without introducing unacceptable regressions. Evaluation is evidence about a defined scope and runtime; it is not proof of general model quality or authorization to release.

Return one disposition:
- **PASS** — predeclared quality and safety gates are met, with no blocking regression;
- **ITERATE** — useful signal exists, but a remediable gap or insufficient evidence remains;
- **REJECT** — value is not demonstrated or a material risk/regression outweighs it.

Do not change the success criteria after seeing candidate results merely to obtain a pass.

## Preconditions

Before running:
- identify the candidate version and the currently accepted comparator;
- require validation with no unresolved blocking errors;
- use representative, versioned routing and behavioral cases with explicit expected outcomes;
- state the evaluation question, supported runtime/model/tool context, and decision threshold;
- record material differences between compared variants.

If any precondition is missing, return the exact gap and the smallest action needed to proceed. Do not present an informal spot check as a complete evaluation.

## Case execution state and receipts

Record two independent fields for every case:
- `outcome`: `passed`, `failed`, or `null` when execution did not produce enough evidence for a verdict;
- `execution_state`: `executed`, `blocked`, `awaiting_runner`, `no_steps`, or `not_executed`.

Use `outcome: passed` or `outcome: failed` only when `execution_state: executed`. For every non-executed state, leave `outcome` null and record the specific reason and evidence. A queued job with no runner is `awaiting_runner`; a job with no executable steps is `no_steps` and has invalid configuration. If both are true, use `no_steps` as the primary state and record the missing runner as an additional condition. An expected result or queued status is not execution evidence.

When writing an evidence receipt, keep the compatibility field `evaluation.status` consistent: use `PASS` or `FAIL` only for an executed outcome; use `NOT_RUN` for non-execution states, with `outcome: null`, the corresponding `execution_state`, and a reason. Do not translate `NOT_RUN`, `BLOCKED`, `awaiting_runner`, or `no_steps` into a behavioral failure.

For browser-based evidence checks, if the browser is unavailable, use `outcome: null` and `execution_state: blocked`; the listing status remains unknown. Do not report `ACTIVE` or `CLOSED` without page evidence. A status mismatch is a failed outcome only after the listing was successfully inspected and the observed status differs from the expected status. If reachability itself is an explicit assertion, an observed navigation failure may fail that assertion; otherwise it does not establish the listing's status.

A textual description of intended tool use is not proof. When the criterion requires a live source check, retain the tool trace, URL/resource, check time and observed status. Do not count a required NOT_RUN or BLOCKED case as a conditional PASS; the overall disposition cannot be PASS while required evidence is unobserved.

## Choose the comparison

- **New capability:** compare with a no-skill baseline when the baseline can attempt the same task safely. If it cannot, state why and evaluate against the approved contract instead.
- **Behavior change:** compare with the last accepted version using equivalent inputs and equivalent runtime conditions.
- **Routing change:** evaluate positive, near-miss, and competing-skill prompts separately from task quality.
- **High-impact or subjective output:** use blind review where practical; remove version cues and randomize presentation order.
- **Deterministic scripts or validators:** prefer direct tests of their inputs, outputs, and failure behavior over model-judged prose.

## Procedure

1. **Freeze the plan.** List cases, comparator, rubric, sample/repetition plan, thresholds and safety stops before observing results.
2. **Check readiness.** Verify candidate identity, validation result, cases, evaluator instructions, tool availability and any required fixtures. Do not silently substitute missing tools or fixtures.
3. **Run routing separately.** Record whether each prompt should trigger the candidate, which capability should win when skills compete, and the observed route.
4. **Run paired behavioral cases.** Give each variant equivalent input, context, permissions, tools and resource limits. Keep the rubric and evaluator criteria identical.
5. **Repeat stochastic cases.** Use enough independent runs to expose material variance for the decision at hand. Report run count and dispersion; do not imply statistical certainty from a small sample.
6. **Score observable outcomes.** Apply predeclared, anchored criteria to the result and its evidence. Separate factual correctness, task completion, contract adherence, tool/action discipline, safety and usability. Mark unobservable or unverified criteria as such.
7. **Compare and inspect regressions.** Report per-case outcome, severity, candidate-versus-comparator delta, variance and evidence. A formatting improvement does not offset a safety or correctness regression without explicit risk acceptance by the proper owner.
8. **Diagnose failures.** Classify likely cause as routing, contract, procedure, reference, tool/runtime, evaluator/rubric, data/fixture or stochastic variance. Label hypotheses as hypotheses.
9. **Preserve learning.** Convert realistic new failures into regression cases through skill-test-design; do not weaken a valid case to obtain a pass.
10. **Decide and report.** Apply the frozen thresholds. State scope, evidence, limitations, unresolved regressions and the smallest next action. PASS does not promote or publish the skill.

## Evaluation criteria

Select only criteria relevant to the skill, but cover its contract:
- trigger and non-trigger correctness;
- completion and output-contract adherence;
- factual and evidence discipline;
- missing, ambiguous, stale or conflicting input handling;
- safety boundaries and external-action discipline;
- tool failure, partial-result and recovery behavior;
- usefulness relative to the comparator;
- material regressions and run-to-run consistency.

Do not score hidden chain-of-thought, exact phrasing, or stylistic preference as a proxy for task quality. Do not treat evaluator agreement, model confidence, or one attractive example as proof.

## Output contract

Return a compact report:
- evaluation question, candidate/comparator and runtime;
- plan and case matrix (case, expected route, observed route, `outcome`, `execution_state`, scores, evidence receipt, severity, delta);
- aggregate result with denominator, repetitions and variation where applicable;
- improvements and regressions, with root-cause hypotheses clearly labeled;
- unsupported/unobserved criteria and material limitations, with required NOT_RUN/BLOCKED cases kept separate from executed results;
- disposition: PASS / ITERATE / REJECT;
- smallest next changes and the exact cases to rerun.

A new skill is not justified merely because it produces a good answer; it should add consistent, decision-relevant value relative to a fair baseline for its intended task.
