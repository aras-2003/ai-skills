description: >
  Monitor an existing investment thesis against new earnings, guidance, industry data, price/valuation changes and
  predefined kill criteria. Use canonical thesis history plus structured research/primary evidence; do not restart
  full underwriting unless the thesis materially changes or evidence becomes stale.

# Thesis Monitor

## Purpose
Evaluate what changed versus the recorded thesis rather than summarizing news from scratch.

## Procedure
1. Load the latest ACTIVE canonical thesis version from `current_theses` and prior monitoring state through investment-record-store.
   - Do not use `draft_theses` as an active thesis.
   - If only a DRAFT exists or no ACTIVE baseline exists, stop before collecting direction-of-thesis conclusions. Return `BLOCKED_THESIS_NOT_ACTIVE`, state that monitoring outcome is not run, and identify the activation/baseline requirement. Do not label the thesis STRENGTHENED, WEAKENED, intact, or healthy.
2. Gather new dated evidence using structured research tools for breadth and primary sources for material claim verification.
3. Classify materiality separately from direction: NOISE / MONITOR / REVIEW / ESCALATE and STRENGTHENS / WEAKENS / MIXED / NEUTRAL.
4. Map each material change to the exact thesis assumption, KPI, catalyst, risk or kill criterion.
5. Update valuation/expectations context separately from business-thesis state.
6. Compare market reaction with fundamental change only as interpretation.
7. Detect portfolio implications such as position drift but route sizing decisions to position-sizing-review.
8. Append a monitoring record as a new canonical research/monitoring event through investment-record-store; never rewrite thesis history.
9. Escalate only when evidence justifies deeper work.

## Decision rules
- News importance is measured against thesis, not headline size.
- Research-provider output does not replace canonical thesis history.
- A DRAFT thesis is not an active monitoring baseline.
- No ACTIVE thesis baseline means no thesis-health outcome; do not substitute generic invalidation criteria for the user's actual recorded thesis.
- Price change alone does not prove thesis change.
- Kill criteria require evidence, not narrative discomfort.
- Historical thesis versions remain immutable.

## Output contract
What changed; materiality; direction; affected thesis element; valuation/expectations impact; market reaction context; next step; persistence receipt.
