# Position Sizing Review

## Purpose
Separate the decision to own an asset from the decision of how much risk to allocate.

## Procedure
1. Load current portfolio state and applicable investment policy.
2. Read surviving thesis, evidence-sanity status, valuation state, priced-in expectations and key uncertainty.
3. If decision-critical evidence is UNVERIFIED/CONFLICTED, stop numeric sizing and return the exact verification requirement.
4. Parse policy semantics literally:
   - review threshold = mandatory review trigger only;
   - hard cap/ceiling = maximum allowed weight only when explicitly defined;
   - target band = desired range only when explicitly defined.
5. Review downside, volatility/liquidity, correlation and existing thematic exposure.
6. Distinguish current weight caused by a new trade from weight drift caused by price appreciation.
7. Determine whether the state supports no position, starter, building, normal/full, hold or reduction review.
8. Express a policy-consistent size band only when the policy actually defines one.
9. State what evidence would justify increasing or decreasing the band.

## Decision rules
- A review threshold is not a hard ceiling.
- If policy says positions above 8% require explicit review, 9.5% means REVIEW REQUIRED; it does not imply trim-to-8%, mandatory reduction or an 8% provisional ceiling.
- A position above a review threshold may remain above it after explicit review if the actual policy permits that exception.
- High conviction does not override portfolio concentration.
- High uncertainty can justify a small starter even when expected value looks attractive.
- A position that became oversized through appreciation may require review despite intact thesis.
- Strong momentum is not permission to add.
- A surviving business thesis does not imply attractive security valuation.
- Without policy or portfolio state, return requirements instead of inventing a percentage.
- When required policy, portfolio, or risk inputs are missing, return `UNRESOLVED`/`BLOCKED` and the specific inputs needed. Do not emit `0%`, `0.0%`, or another numeric placeholder as a position recommendation; zero is a substantive recommendation, not a missing-data marker.
- Do not recommend ADD/TRIM or an exact numeric band from a case with missing decision-critical evidence.
- Without a verified valuation/priced-in assessment, do not recommend adding to an already-large position.

## Output contract
Lifecycle state; business-thesis state; security-attractiveness state; priced-in context; policy rule type; review-trigger status; explicit cap/band only if actually present; current weight; drift source; constraints; rationale; add conditions; reduce conditions; missing/blocked data.

## Quality checks
- [ ] Policy and portfolio state were used.
- [ ] Review threshold was not converted into a ceiling or trim target.
- [ ] Conviction and sizing are not conflated.
- [ ] Business thesis, valuation and portfolio fit are separate.
- [ ] Market-driven drift is distinguished from a new trade.
- [ ] Unverified critical evidence blocks numeric sizing.
- [ ] No unsupported exact percentage is invented.
