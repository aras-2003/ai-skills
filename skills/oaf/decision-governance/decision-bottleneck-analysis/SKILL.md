description: >
  Diagnose why a specific material decision class is slow, repeatedly escalated or duplicated by tracing decision steps, waits, vetoes, evidence gaps and authority boundaries. Use after the problematic decision class and its decision owner/path are sufficiently identified; when the core unknown is who has final authority, lead with decision-rights-review. Do not lead a mixed cross-unit handoff/accountability/capacity diagnosis whose failure type is still unknown.

# Decision Bottleneck Analysis

## Purpose
Find the actual source of latency for an identified decision class rather than assuming governance is too heavy.

If the user says decisions circulate or escalate because nobody knows who has final decision authority, route first to `decision-rights-review`. Use this workflow later only if the owner/path is clear enough to investigate elapsed time, waits, repeated gates or rework.

If the prompt primarily mixes cross-unit handoffs, unclear accountability and capacity/funding authority without naming a decision class, first use the operating-model diagnostic to classify the failure.

## Procedure
1. Select a small set of recent material decisions.
2. Reconstruct proposer, advisers, approvers/decision owner, evidence, timestamps and escalations.
3. Compare the formal path with the actual path.
4. Separate active decision work, queue time, handoffs, waiting and rework where evidence permits.
5. Identify duplicate review, hidden veto, missing evidence, authority ambiguity, risk aversion and resource dependency.
6. Quantify latency only where timestamps or working-time evidence support it.
7. Recommend the smallest bottleneck-removal experiment. It must distinguish the leading bottleneck hypothesis from its strongest plausible alternative: state intervention, comparison/baseline, observable measure, time window, and what result would support or falsify each explanation. If inputs do not permit such a test, state the missing data; do not present a generic intervention as a validating experiment.

## Decision rules
- Do not infer bottlenecks from org charts alone.
- A slow decision does not automatically mean too many approvers.
- Missing evidence, sequential review, duplicate review, shadow vetoes, queue time and authority ambiguity are distinct failure modes.
- A formal adviser can act as a de facto gate; verify this from actual progression behavior.
- Hidden vetoes count even when absent from formal governance.
- Do not call a review duplicate unless scope/evidence shows no material reason for repetition.
- More governance is not a solution to unclear authority.

## Output contract
Decision | formal path | actual path | wait points | vetoes/gates | missing evidence | authority issue | latency | bottleneck hypothesis | validation experiment.

Then:
- active work vs waiting/rework;
- hidden vetoes and duplicate reviews;
- authority diagnosis;
- smallest bottleneck-removal experiment;
- remaining evidence needed.

## Model guidance
Default: **standard**.
Validated on Luna for decision-path diagnosis and latency analysis.
Fast may be adequate for clean, structured decision logs. Escalate where executive authority or actual decision behavior is highly contested.

## Quality checks
- [ ] Formal vs actual path compared.
- [ ] Waiting/rework distinguished from decision work where evidence allows.
- [ ] Adviser vs de facto gate distinction tested.
- [ ] Duplicate review remains evidence-based.
- [ ] Smallest experiment targets the strongest confirmed bottleneck.
